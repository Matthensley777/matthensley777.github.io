WYSIWYG was by far the most challenging, there was a lot of layers to it.  All in all I feel like I have a pretty good grasp on event listeners at this point.",

I love pulling an array from a JSON file rather than have a large array in my main file. Our first assignement we pulled from 2 different JSON files that work together to populate the results we wanted.",
